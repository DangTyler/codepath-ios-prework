## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

For adding buttons or images, it wasn't specified that you had to drag and drop
the components, so I was confused at first. Also, for adding the IBAction for the
button, the tutorial didn't specify that you also had to hold ctrl while dragging
in order for the IBAction to be created.
